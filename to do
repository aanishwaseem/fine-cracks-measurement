    #RUNNING remove_gridlines and detect_cracks_no_area functions are TIME CONSUMING . consumes about 50 secs per img

    mainly due to 2 inference models : deepcrack and crack_segmentator
    
    sols: either:
    -  running deepcrack and crack_segementator models via multithreading
    - or instead of calling both models with this command = [
        sys.executable,
        "inference_unet.py",
        "-img_dir", f"./{tiles_dir}",
        "-model_path", "models/model_unet_vgg16_best.pt",
        .....
        we call inference_unet function directly by importing

    scenerio:
    3 stages; removing gridlines in the image, running 2 crack models and finally merging the output of 2 cracks
    - crack_segmentator is independent (called inside getBinaryImage)
    - deepcrack pipeline is called inside remove_gridlines function
    - remove_gridlines functions need a deepcrack image generated from deepcrack_pipeline
    - after both models complete the output, they are merged inside getBinaryImage

    current problem before doing parallelism in both models:
    the img is broken down into 300x300 tiles both for crack_segmentator and deepcrack_pipeline. the tiles saved for deepcrack model is also inside crack_segmentator folder.  therefore it should be inside deepcrack model's own folder  

    to run the code:
    - go to E:\crack-20260128T190731Z-3-001\crack\venv\Scripts
    - open command terminal in this directory
    - write activate
    - go back to E:\crack-20260128T190731Z-3-001\crack
    write in terminal: 
iopaint start --model lama --device cuda --port 8000 --realesrgan-model RealESRGAN_x4plus --realesrgan-device cuda --enable-realesrgan
    - wait for the iopaint server to start



    - now open another terminal
    -activate the venv again by following the first 3 steps above
- py crack.py
- choose /dataset/d-cropped
- choose /references/cropped_d_cleanup.png
